# Flappy Bird NEAT AI üê¶üß†

This project implements a Flappy Bird AI using the NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The AI learns to play Flappy Bird by evolving a neural network that controls the bird's flight.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Pygame
* Neat-python

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/biiiliii/pacman_neat.git
```
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the AI, execute the following command:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py
```

This will start the game and train the AI. You can watch the AI learn and improve its performance over time.

## Configuration
The NEAT configuration parameters are located in the neat_config.txt file. You can modify these parameters to experiment with different settings and see how they affect the AI's performance.
